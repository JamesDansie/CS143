Project: PA2 - Game Of Life GUI for CS 143

I actually had a hard time getting stared on this project. I didn't really understand the relationship between containers and components. So I started by doing the other projects (LA2 and CE2) first, and hoping I would understand by the time I was done with those. Before I started this project I started doing some smaller, more simple drawings first. I drew some Xs and squares using both DrawingPanel and the JComponent. Once I had a better understanding of that I started drawing the board. Again I had a hard time understanding the buttons and mouse listeners, so I tried out the example codes from the week, and I checked out some stack overflow examples to get a better understanding. I actually found the provided source code from the class to be pretty complicated and confusing (why are we overriding a JFrame vs JPanel? What is a button handler?), whereas the stack overflow examples were simpler, and easier to grasp.

I've completed the project up to the challenger level, so everything seems to be working now. One of the ongoing challenges is that the board uses the 1-19 numbering where as the arrays use 0-18. This caused a bit of trouble in the following code;

        	for(int row = 1; row <= 19; row++) {
			for(int col = 1; col <= 19; col++) {
				state = game.getCellState(row, col);
              			    if(state == 1)
					g.fillOval((col-1)*25+5, (row-1)*25+5, 15, 15);
			}
		}

The game.getCellState works with the 1-19 numbering system whereas the col and row work with 0-18. At first I didn't have the (col-1) and (row-1), and everything was off by one cell. That took a long time to find. 

I've learned a lot about graphics with components, buttons, mouses, and action listeners. I wish I understood the button handler better. My main code looks a bit bloated, if I were to do this again I wonder if I could move some of the button and panel defintions into the constructor so the main method was more clear.
