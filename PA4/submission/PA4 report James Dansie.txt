Project: PA4 - Stack/Queue, Array Implementation - Standard Level

I started this project by reading the arraylist class notes. Then I downloaded the support files and scratched my head. I started working through the arraylist class notes and trying to make an array list. While I was working on that I would review the book's chp 15 and the section about iterators in chp 11. In hindsight I didn't need the iterator, but I wrote it anyways. The weirdest part was the generic implementation. It would have been nice to have a stepping stone between something I understood. It was hard to make an array list and a generic type when I haven't done either before. Once I had a functional array list I started implementing the interfaces.

All the functions work and compile without warnings. Also the javadocs are all done without errors. Everything seems to work.

I made a test.java at the level of the csc143 directory so I could use import csc143.data_structures.*; without adding it to the classpath (this is reused from PA3). All the methods and limit tests were tested this way.

Probably the hardest part was the use of the generic type. I'm still trying to wrap my head around that, and when I have to use <E> or E instead of object.

Next time I would leave out the iterator.
